This is a collection of Matlab functions that were developed around Tephra2.

* **plotT2.m** plots the output of Tephra2 on a map. It can be used with the functions *plot_google_map* and *utm2ll* (both available on the Matlab File Exchange) to plot the output on a Google Map background
* **runT2.m** (experimental) runs Tephra2 and allows sensitivity analyses of parameters
* **makeBeta.m** plots the mass distribution in the column using a Beta PDF, which is the model used in Tephra2
